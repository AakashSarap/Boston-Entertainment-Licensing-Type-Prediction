# Boston-Entertainment-Licensing-Type-Prediction


## About the Dataset
Boston Entertainment Licensing data is a legacy dataset containing licenses issued by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Licensing from November 2014 through Februrary 2015.

## Business Question
* What are the types of licenses?
* What is the relation between neighbourhood and types of licenses issued ?

## Analysis
I have analyzed criteria to obtain Entertainment Licenses from the Office of Consumer Affairs and Licensing when holding certain types of events in the City. Examples include holding public shows such as live music and dancing by patrons or performers, non-live entertainment like arcades and jukeboxes, or one-time events such as carnivals and exhibitions. The licensing process is designed to ensure public events do not violate any laws or cause disruptions.
