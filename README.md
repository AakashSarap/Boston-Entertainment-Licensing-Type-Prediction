# Boston-Entertainment-Licensing-Type-Prediction


## About the Dataset
This is a legacy dataset containing licenses issued by the Office of Consumer Affairs and Licensing from November 2014 through Februrary 2015.

## Business Question
* What are the types of licenses?
* What is the relation between neighbourhood and types of licenses issued ?

## Analysis
I have analyzed criteria to obtain Entertainment Licenses from the Office of Consumer Affairs and Licensing when holding certain types of events in the City. Examples include holding public shows such as live music and dancing by patrons or performers, non-live entertainment like arcades and jukeboxes, or one-time events such as carnivals and exhibitions. The licensing process is designed to ensure public events do not violate any laws or cause disruptions.

Import Neccessary Libraries
For this project I imported the following libraries and packages to analyze the Boston Food Establishment Inspection data set. Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib.PyPlot, Seaborn, StatsModel and SKLearn. These libraries enable us to load, manipulate, analyze, visualize and forecast the data. We also imported a few datetime libraries to support trend analysis of the data.
